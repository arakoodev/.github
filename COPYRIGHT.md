# Arakoo & EdgeChains Trademark Policy


The objective of this policy is to encourage widespread use of the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark (including
both the coloured logo above and the word) by our community while regulating that use in order to
avoid confusion (on the part of service providers, users and the general public), to safeguard the
value of the image and reputation of the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark and associated software tools and materials.

The Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark is designed to cover use of a mark to imply origin or endorsement by the Arakoo & EdgeChains
project. When a user downloads something called Arakoo & EdgeChains, they should know it comes from the Arakoo & EdgeChains project.
This helps Arakoo & EdgeChains build a reputation that will not be damaged by confusion around what is, and isn't, Arakoo & EdgeChains.

### In summary:
* Third parties ("you") can use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark, in accordance with these guidelines, or with
permission in writing of Arakoo.
* Express permission is required to use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademarks in any name or title that *identifies*
a software product or services (including SaaS services), any domain name or URL.
* If you are developing a software application (e.g. a data analysis workflow), or creating services
that use or interact with Arakoo & EdgeChains, you may reference Arakoo & EdgeChains in a *descriptive* manner (e.g. "based on Arakoo & EdgeChains"),
but must avoid any direct implication or an endorsement by the Arakoo & EdgeChains project or its authors.
* You can use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark in discussion, commentary, criticism or parody, provided that you do not imply
endorsement by the Arakoo & EdgeChains project or its authors.
* You can write articles, create websites, blogs or talk about Arakoo & EdgeChains, provided that it is clear that you are
in no way speaking for or on behalf of Arakoo & EdgeChains project or its authors and that you do not imply an endorsement by them.

### Permitted uses

Certain uses of the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark do not require specific permission.

*	**Community use**. Arakoo & EdgeChains was and is still being built by the Arakoo & EdgeChains project collaborators, largely
for the benefit of the machine learning community. Arakoo & EdgeChains is distributed under an open source license, principally to encourage use and further development of the platform in an open, collaborative and free manner. Members of this
community may use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark for the purposes of discussion, development and advocacy.

*	**Non-commercial (e.g. academic) use**. This type of use of the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark is permitted without further
authorisation, provided that you do so in accordance with these guidelines, there is there is no commercial intent
behind the use, you are referring to the Arakoo & EdgeChains project, tools and/or materials; and there is no suggestion
(through words or appearance) that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with the Arakoo & EdgeChains project
or it authors. **Note**: This does not stop you creating commercial or non-commercial projects using or developing
Arakoo & EdgeChains-oriented tools and interfaces, but you should not use the Arakoo & EdgeChains mark (or any mark confusingly similar) to identify your project.

* **Developing your own applications (e.g. workflows) using Arakoo & EdgeChains**. If you are implementing a workflow application
using Arakoo & EdgeChains, you may use the trademark in a way that describes how Arakoo & EdgeChains is related to your application.
For example, acceptable use would be "[Name] is a workflow application based on Arakoo & EdgeChains", "[Name] is a Arakoo & EdgeChains-driven workflow application".

*	**Developing and modifying the Arakoo & EdgeChains platform and tools**. The ability to customise Arakoo & EdgeChains platform and tools to
meet your specific needs is one of the great strengths of free and open source software. You may adapt and modify
Arakoo & EdgeChains platform and tools in accordance with the corresponding license (which includes attribution to the Arakoo & EdgeChains project, for which you may obviously use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark). If you are creating a derivative work of Arakoo & EdgeChains (i.e. a modification of the Arakoo & EdgeChains source code), you should give your new product a different name but you can use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark when describing it (e.g. "based on Arakoo & EdgeChains", "forked from Arakoo & EdgeChains" or "compatible with Arakoo & EdgeChains", etc.), (complying the more detailed conditions set out below).

* **Creating an extension for Arakoo & EdgeChains or integrating Arakoo & EdgeChains in your own application or software stack**. If you are producing new software or a service that is intended for use with Arakoo & EdgeChains or integrates the Arakoo & EdgeChains runtime, you may use the trademark in a way which describes the intent of your application or how Arakoo & EdgeChains is related to your application or product. For example, if you are developing an extension component for Arakoo & EdgeChains, acceptable project names would be "[Name] plugin for Arakoo & EdgeChains" or "[Name] is a platform integrating Arakoo & EdgeChains software".

*	**Commentary about Arakoo & EdgeChains**. Using the trademarks in discussion, commentary or criticism (or even parody),
in ways that unequivocally do not imply endorsement, is permissible. Anyone is free to write articles, create
websites, blog about, or talk about Arakoo & EdgeChains - as long as it's clear to everyone - including people completely
unfamiliar with Arakoo & EdgeChains - that they are simply referring to Arakoo & EdgeChains and in no way speaking for the Arakoo & EdgeChains project or its authors.

For example, the following statements are permitted, as they make descriptive use of "Arakoo & EdgeChains" mark:
* [Your name] is a workflow runtime for Arakoo & EdgeChains based applications.
* [Your name] cloud is a platform for Arakoo & EdgeChains based workflows.
* Quick start for Arakoo & EdgeChains by [Your Company]
* [Your Company] provides training solutions for developers working with Arakoo & EdgeChains technologies.
* [Your Company] provides commercial grade support for Arakoo & EdgeChains based applications and deployments.

Expressions such as "Arakoo & EdgeChains applications" or "Arakoo & EdgeChains developers" (other than those provided or engaged
by the Arakoo & EdgeChains project itself), i.e. using "Arakoo & EdgeChains" to identify the applications or developers, are not
permitted, as they indicate that the applications or developers are created by or hired by the Arakoo & EdgeChains
project. For these scenarios, you should use expressions like "Arakoo & EdgeChains based applications" or "developers
skilled with Arakoo & EdgeChains". Nor may you use the Arakoo & EdgeChains trademark for promoting third party commercial
activities inferring any sponsorship, affiliation, or creation/founding of the project.   

For example, the following statements are not permitted:
*	Arakoo & EdgeChains by [Your Company]
*	Arakoo & EdgeChains - [Your Company]
*	[Your Name/Company] - Arakoo & EdgeChains
*	Arakoo & EdgeChains Quick Start by [Your Company]
*	Arakoo & EdgeChains application by [Your Company]

We reserve the right to review all usage within the open source community and commercial partners and
other entities, and to object to any usage that appears to overstep the bounds of discussion and good-faith.
In any event, once a project has left the open source project phase or otherwise become a commercial project,
this policy does not authorize any use of the trademarks in connection to that project, except as a
reference to origin and source.
